First coding day of 2023! Let's fucking go!

I somehow missed out the notification that the class that was supposed to happen on New Year's Day was postponed till today, so luckily I was already at home at my seat, I hopped onto class and did some things! (see #2)

### What I did today:

1. Continued working on the front-end project on The Odin Project. [Click here to see it!](https://ezekielmiles.github.io/theodinproject-landingpage/)
2. For LeWagon class, built our own profile page also run on GitHub pages. [Click here to see it!](https://ezekielmiles.github.io/profile/)

Good thing I revised quite a little CSS/HTML from The Odin Project, I was able to build the profile page really quickly in less than 30minutes.

### What I'll be working on tomorrow:

I'm done with The Odin Project's CSS/HTML section, but Le Wagon has additional syllabus for front-end stuff like CSS Components and Bootstrap.

So tomorrow, I'll get started on JavaScript (TOP) for 2 hours and then do 2 hours of Le Wagon syllabus to see if I can get ahead since I'll be heading to Phuket for 5 days next week!

Feeling good about everything and excited for the upcoming interview for my internship!

With love,
