This is a quick draft of the first post of my coding blog run on GitHub pages.

I figured that all these small blog posts wouldn't be that fancy enough to land on my main personal website (don't think anyone would wanna see me talk about beginner programmer problems).

So yes, let's make this work!

Main purpose: **the blog was for past me to talk to future me, for future me to judge my past me, for present me to be encouraged by past me.**

Thanks for the inspiration Shawn SWYX Wang!
