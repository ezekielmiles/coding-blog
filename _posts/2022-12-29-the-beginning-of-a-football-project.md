# The Beginning Of A Football Project 

I'll be honest. Starting No Zero Days right smack before Christmas isn't a good idea. I ended up not really coding much for the past 3 days. But there's no point being hard on myself. Just keep going and break the zeros!

## Learning is best done by DOING, not READING/COPYING

In the past 2 months of learning coding through The Odin Project and Le Wagon (a singapore in-person bootcamp), I realised that I get most excited when I am applying what I've learnt onto ACTUAL exercises. Coding challenges tests if you've gotten the concepts in place... but I believe projects are what brings my learning to the next level. 

After all, I'm learning to code for the sake of it. I'm learning to code to become both a better thinker and problem solver. And what's the best way to do that?

By actually solving a personal problem I'm seeing in my life!

## Introducing: Finder's Football

This idea has been in my head for a while now since I've been participating in weekly football games in Singapore. There are tons of 11-aside football games happening every weekend. 

Here are the problems I've witnessed myself:
 - Referees have to send a huge list of fields that they have available to team captains to somewhat "sell" the pitch and referee service
 - Captains have to quickly get these pitches and get their team players to "confirm" that they can make it for the game so the captains don't end up booking a pitch and end up not having players
 - Players that don't have teams have a tough time finding teams to play for if they want to play some 11-aside football.

The only alternative that is currently available in Singapore is Stranger Soccer, which has more games hosting for weekdays and caters to the foreigner crowd (not the local crowd playing 11-aside in secondary school pitches by the government)

Of course, this isn't a million dollar idea that I'm pulling off. I'm sure others have tried etc, but after reading books by Sahil Lavingia and Arvid Kahl... I'm convinced that I'm right smack in the middle of this PROBLEM as I'm a user myself. And that is when I can create the best product myself.

## Learning Objectives

As a person learning to code and build products, I take this as a learning experience to learn a couple of things and while doing... also to LEARN IN PUBLIC:

1. UI/UX Design (How to design an app that a referee, captain/player can use)
2. Building the Web App itself (ah this will probably take a while since I'm still in the middle of my bootcamp)
3. Apply my previous marketing/copywriting skills onto making a nice landing page that could kickstart things!
4. Learning whatever else that is needed to bootstrap a cool product that people in my local community are using

##  100% Free once it's up and running. Why? Win-win.

I get to learn and apply my skills on something I love. (Football)
People get to use the product for free and make organising/playing football easier.
I don't have to deal with payments/compete in the business game.

I do this not for money, but for learning and further opportunities. That means I will play the infinite game. (no losses, just learning)

### Let's get started! 

So I'm going to write every thought process and just try to *SHOW MY WORK* (credits: Austin Kleon). This coding blog was supposed to be for my learning of coding, but I'm sure it'll be more interesting to see me bring an idea from 0 to 1.
