Good evening! It's New Year's Eve. Today's main objective was to complete the Le Wagon's bootcamp challenges for the day. I skipped in-person class. Yes, because it's New Year's Day, I don't plan to wake up at 7.30am to head to class to do coding problems when I can do it at home. Furthermore, there's probably going to be a party tonight so I want to have the energy to have fun then.

While writing this coding blog thingy, I think it'll be a good idea to fixate the questions and prompts so that each post will be consistent. The more consistent it is, the easier for future me to read. (So I can judge my own work and thoughts)

I'm not sure what questions I should use but I'll just copy a daily coding stand-up template.

Oh nevermind, I found a super solid LEARNING PLAN.

I should model this now. Interesting, as you can see above... Amina splits all her learning journey and activities into a sprint. Good idea. Weekly sprints should be a little too micro as I'm still a noobie learning and have nothing much to cover every week. But a monthly sprint should be ideal.

As today is the 31st December... let's take this chance to do a MONTHLY CODING SPRINT for January 2023. (because if I don't do it now, I'm going to procrastinate and not do it)

Be right back, working on January 2023 Coding Sprint.

Oh yeah! BTW, I got a interview for an internship at an awesome company that I was looking forward to work for! That's the new beginning in the title!

New Year Vibes,
Ezekiel
